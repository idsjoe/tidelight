# *Hotel California by The Eagles*

There are songs you hear, enjoy, put on repeat for forever… and then there are songs you relish, songs that possess you.

*Hotel California* is the latter of those two. You don’t press the skewed triangle to play it, it *arrives*. You’re always drawn to it, and you never really know when.

*Hotel California*, also the name of the album this drug of a song belongs to, was The Eagles’ fifth album, a band often credited with refining the fusion of country and rock in the early seventies.

Fun fact, before I delve further into the song, the album cover features the Beverly Hills Hotel, also known as *The Pink Palace*, with an electric blue font embossed on top of it, called **Mr. Canfield**. This choice of font alone could warrant an entire blog post, but I digress.

From the very first notes, the guitar doesn’t show off. It accompanies the mood the song tries to set… unhinged, warm, and humid. Yes. *Humid*. I didn’t even realise three guitars were used in this song, weaving into each other so naturally it feels effortless. The bass isn’t an attention [redacted] either, my parents read this, but it’s like bay leaf. You can’t point it out, yet you will immediately feel its absence if it’s gone.

If you’re a Swiftie turned song blogger, like myself, you cannot approach this song with the intent of hunting for Easter eggs or hidden clues, because *Hotel California* is not meant to be understood. Fifty years ago, songs came from emotions and loose ideas rather than intentional symbolism. Add to that long nights and overworked musicians… they were grinding long before Sabrina Carpenter made it fashionable, and you get lyrics that feel true without needing to make sense.

Personally, I’ve always read this song as leaning toward insanity. Toward how difficult it can be to escape a self imposed prison, however lucrative it may seem on a tiring night. That idea is present right from the opening:

> On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair  
> Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air  
> Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light  
> My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim  
> I had to stop for the night  

You’re done with whatever your Warsaw is. You’re on autopilot. Suddenly, this idea of escapism, of putting your worries away in a bottle even for a moment, appears right in front of you and you just can’t say no.

Then you see a woman. Back then, a woman was often a metaphor for relaxation, reward, or reprimand. She stands there in a hallway, and you’re dumbfounded by the sheer absurdity of the situation, because on one hand there’s her, and on the other there are these strange voices echoing down the corridor.

> There she stood in the doorway  
> I heard the mission bell  
> And I was thinking to myself  
> “This could be Heaven or this could be Hell”  

> There were voices down the corridor  

If you’ve ever heard a mission bell, you know how hypnotising that sound can be. It only reinforces how well written, if not entirely well thought out, these lyrics are.

> Welcome to the Hotel California  
> Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)  
> Such a lovely face  
> Plenty of room at the Hotel California  
> Any time of year (Any time of year)  

In this quasi bridge, The Eagles use repetition as a tool to force you into believing you are in *The Good Place™*. “Such a lovely place” and “Any time of year” repeat, gently pushing you into a trance this deep into the song.

The horrors of this self imposed prison dawn on you when the Captain tells you there is no wine. You hear voices calling from far away. It becomes lucid that you are boxed in, surrounded by mirrors on the ceiling, unable to kill the beast. Everyone knows anything mortal, anything bound to reality, should die when stabbed with steely knives… yet this one doesn’t.

> So I called up the Captain  
> “Please bring me my wine”  
> He said,  
> “We haven’t had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine”  

> And still those voices are calling from far away  

> Mirrors on the ceiling  

> “We are all just prisoners here, of our own device”  

> They stab it with their steely knives  
> But they just can’t kill the beast  

And finally, showing just how cruel this fantasy can be, this escapist, insane land of drugs, alcohol, and daydreaming, when you finally wake up and try to resurface, it dawns on you that you are too far gone.

> Last thing I remember, I was running for the door  
> I had to find the passage back  
> To the place I was before  
> “Relax,” said the night man  
> “We are programmed to receive  
> You can check-out any time you like  
> But you can never leave!”  

This song stands as the *ne plus ultra* of seventies songwriters using a little more than just their imagination to write music… cough, drugs, cough. Don Henley, lead vocalist and drummer of the Eagles, has claimed the song is a socio political statement. I can see how it reads as a metaphor for the United States at the time, but honestly, when you’re listening to this song in a haze, when your mind gets foggy without having touched any spirits unavailable since 1969, you begin to suspect that even he doesn’t fully know what the song means.

Not bad for the lead track of a so called concept album.
