			<p>Forty odd years ago, in the picturesque town of Sevenoaks, England, a woman named Kate Bush wrote the first song of her fifth studio album, <em>Hounds of Love</em>, in a single evening. She sang a drum beat to her boyfriend and recording engineer, Del Palmer, and claimed that the lyrics to the first verse “came straight away”.</p>

			<p>Yes, we all know this song through <em>Stranger Things</em>. Let us not pretend otherwise. It was a powerful choice in that context, no spoilers here, but the brilliance of this song deserves appreciation outside of the show.</p>

			<p>Many people don’t realise that Kate Bush is one of the key figures responsible for making us associate jazzy synthesizer sounds with the retro 80s aesthetic. It was her album <em>Never for Ever</em> that marked the first extensive use of the Fairlight CMI synthesizer. That very machine produces the iconic synthesizer sound we hear in <em>Running Up That Hill</em>.</p>

			<p>I won’t go full music nerd here, but the tension throughout the song comes from its driving drum beat and the use of the balalaika, a Russian string instrument that adds those punchy accents to the rhythm. There is always a slight twist… an extra line here, one line less there, a repeat placed exactly where it needs to be. There is absolutely no dead space. The song is deceptively simple. Kate also uses dissonance, unstable notes and chords that create a sense of unrest and an almost physical desire for resolution.</p>

			<p><strong>THUMP duh duh dun duh duh | THUMP duh duh dun duh duh.</strong></p>

			<p>This is the heartbeat of the song from the very beginning. After a few listens, you start noticing your own pulse syncing with it, quietly at first, then unmistakably. That might be true for many songs, but here it feels inescapable, like the track has found a way inside you.</p>

            <p>The song was originally meant to be titled <em>A Deal with God</em>, but that risked offending a fair number of religious nuts, so it became <em>Running Up That Hill</em> instead. Honestly, I’m glad it did. The new title feels lighter, more kinetic, like motion rather than doctrine. It sounds exactly like what the song does to you.</p>


			<p>Kate has explained that the song is about the need to understand your husband or partner. The “deal with God” is about switching places, about being in each other’s shoes to truly understand one another. It is about a relationship between a man and a woman who love each other deeply, but where the power dynamics within that relationship create insecurity. If the man could be the woman and the woman the man, if they could make a deal with God and change places, then misunderstandings might dissolve. All the little problems would no longer exist.</p>

			<p>Yet I find myself inevitably returning to the context in which this song was used in <em>Stranger Things</em>, where Max listens to it to escape Vecna’s grasp and pull herself out of the Upside Down.</p>

			<p>Unlike yesterday’s blog, where I wrote about <em>Hotel California</em> and how that song traps you inside your own cage, the contrast here is striking. I swear I did not plan this, but there is something beautiful about covering two songs that sit on opposite sides of the same coin on consecutive days. One conveys the feeling of a self imposed prison. The other shows how music can help you escape it, pulling you out of a dark place.</p>
