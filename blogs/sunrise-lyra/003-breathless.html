			<p>There’s a certain kind of excitement that makes you talk too fast not because you have too much to say but because you’re scared the feeling might disappear if you give it a moment to think and <em>Breathless</em> lives entirely inside that fear moreover people love reducing this song to a novelty asking whether he really sang it in one breath which he didn’t and honestly who cares because obsessing over oxygen misses the point entirely since the song doesn’t sound like lungs at work it sounds like a mind refusing to slow down afraid that silence might poke holes in the feeling and expose it for what it really is and this isn’t romance that’s settled into itself this is romance mid sprint mid-overthinking mid-oversharing mid-sarsarahat sansanahat gudgudahat dagmagahat farfarahat thartharahat kapkapahat bharbharahat dabdabahat chhatpatahat fadfadahat sugbugahat kulbulahat gudgudai chilmilai you know the exact kind where one thought crashes into the next and none of them know how to end properly and this is where Javed fricking Akhtar walks in and quietly rewires the entire thing because these lyrics don’t behave like lyrics at all they behave like thought written down too quickly to be cleaned up sentences refusing symmetry clauses tumbling over each other with no interest in being pretty or quotable or neatly poetic this is Hindi used the way the brain actually uses it when it’s overwhelmed when it’s excited when it’s afraid to pause because pausing would invite doubt and Javed lets that chaos exist on the page without taming it without polishing it into shayari without turning it into something performative he writes momentum not metaphor breathless cognition rather than verse letting emotion outrun structure on purpose and Shankar Mahadevan for a singer who could stop time with his voice chooses not to he strips away ornamentation refuses to linger avoids the kind of pauses that would let the song admire itself because admiration would mean stillness and stillness would mean doubt so he keeps moving keeps pushing keeps spilling the music follows suit nothing settles long enough to feel safe the rhythm nudges instead of landing the harmony supports without resolving too soon and even the silences are rationed like they’re afraid of what might sneak in if there’s too much space what we mistake for joy here is really tension joy with a pulse racing just fast enough to be nervous happiness that hasn’t learned how to sit down yet the kind that makes you speak faster than you should laugh louder than necessary and hold on just a little too tightly because letting go feels like tempting fate by the time the song ends you realise you’ve been listening the same way it speaks leaning forward shoulders raised jaw clenched not because it’s loud or dramatic but because it never lets you relax into certainty and when it finally stops it doesn’t feel finished it feels interrupted like a thought cut off mid-sentence because someone finally had to breathe and maybe that’s why <em>Breathless</em> hasn’t aged into a novelty because once you stop counting seconds and start listening to what it’s actually doing you realise it isn’t showing off endurance it’s capturing a moment before emotions learn how to behave.</p>
